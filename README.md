Dataset for Deep Learning


This dataset contains 100 normal head CT slices and 100 other with hemorrhage. No distinction between kinds of hemorrhage.
Labels are on a CSV file. Each slice comes from a different person.
The main idea of such a small dataset is to develop ways to predict imaging findings even in a context of little data.
In this notebook, I present a simple data augmentation capable of achieving 90% accuracy in the test set.
